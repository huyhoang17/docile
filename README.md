# Development instructions
We use https://python-poetry.org/docs/ for dependency management. Follow the official instructions
for installation, then run `poetry install` to install the dependencies into virtual environment
and `poetry shell` to spawn a new shell with this virtual environment activated.

You will also need https://pre-commit.com/ for pre-commit checks. If you have done the steps above,
it is already installed in your virtual environment and you only need to call `pre-commit install`.
